# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

Real estate prices are one of the most important economic indicators, affecting both individuals and businesses.
Accurate price prediction is essential for making informed decisions regarding buying, selling, and investing in real estate.
Also, buying a house is one of the biggest financial goals of everyone. There are many factors that need to be considered to
predict efficient house pricing for customers with respect to their budget as well as according to their priorities by analyzing market
strategies. Even with vast amounts of data available, we do not have accurate measures to predict housing prices. Hence, the main
aim of our project is to predict the accurate price of real estate using ML through which we can build a model which can make
predictions based on past data. The findings of this research will be useful for real estate agents, buyers, and sellers in making
informed decisions based on accurate price predictions. It will also help buyers to make decisions without the need of a broker.
